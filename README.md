# Jira Activity Analyzer

First static desktop UI prototype for Jira Activity Analyzer / Activity Builder.

This is an Electron desktop app shell with a React renderer. The first version is mock UI only: no Jira API calls, database writes, token storage, backup restore, import, or export behavior is implemented.

## Scripts

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` starts the Electron desktop app and loads the Vite renderer in development mode.
- `npm run build` builds the React renderer and Electron main/preload bundles.
- `npm run dist` builds Windows installer and portable artifacts with electron-builder under `release/`.
- `npm run preview` opens the production build in Electron.

## Build Time

The app injects `__BUILD_TIME__` from `vite.config.ts`.

- `npm run dev`: `Development Mode`
- `npm run build` / `npm run dist`: Asia/Taipei timestamp in `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss` format

Build Time is shown in the sidebar and in Settings > System Status.

## Electron Security

- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false`
- renderer does not receive direct Node.js API access
- production loads `dist/index.html`
- development loads the local Vite dev server only for the Electron window
